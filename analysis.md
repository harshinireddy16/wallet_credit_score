## Wallet Behavior Analysis

###  Wallets with Low Scores (0â€“200):
- Frequently perform risky operations such as borrowing without sufficient collateral.
- Often experience liquidation calls due to over-leveraged positions.
- Have inconsistent repayment behavior, indicating poor financial responsibility.
- Are classified under "High Risk" and "Very High Risk" in the scoring.

### ðŸ”º Wallets with High Scores (800â€“1000):
- Show consistent and safe usage patterns such as regular deposits and repayments.
- Rarely or never face liquidation, and often maintain healthy collateralization.
- Demonstrate low-risk behavior, earning "Low Risk" or "Very Low Risk" tags.
- Are typically well-aligned with the protocolâ€™s best practices.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- The score model successfully differentiates between high-risk and low-risk wallets.
- Most wallets are concentrated in the 500â€“700 range, with a small portion achieving very high or very low scores.
- This analysis can support protocol design decisions, such as flagging risky borrowers, adjusting interest rates, or offering incentives to high-performing wallets.
